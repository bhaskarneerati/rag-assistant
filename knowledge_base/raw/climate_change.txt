# Climate Change — Causes, Evidence, Effects, and What We Can Do

## Overview
Climate change refers to long-term changes in the Earth’s average weather patterns. Some natural forces have always changed climate over long time scales. Today’s rapid warming is mainly due to human actions. When people burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, they release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.

## The Greenhouse Effect — Simple Picture
Think of the Earth as wearing a blanket. Sunlight warms the ground. The ground gives off heat, but greenhouse gases trap some of that heat in the atmosphere. This process is the greenhouse effect. A small increase in these gases makes the blanket thicker, so more heat stays near Earth.

## Evidence of Change
Scientists measure changes in many ways. Global average temperatures have risen. Ice sheets and glaciers are shrinking in many places. Sea levels are rising as ice melts and ocean water expands when it warms. Weather patterns are shifting: some regions become drier, others see more heavy rain. Oceans grow warmer and more acidic because they take in carbon dioxide.

## Causes Beyond Fossil Fuels
Human land changes also affect climate. Clearing forests can reduce the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon. Agriculture releases methane from livestock and rice paddies. Some industrial processes release other greenhouse gases. All these effects add up.

## Effects on People and Nature
Climate change affects food, water, health, and economies. Crops can be harmed by heat or drought in some regions and sometimes helped in others. Extreme weather—storms, floods, and heat waves—can destroy homes and farms. Sea level rise threatens coastal areas. Ecosystems change, forcing species to move or face extinction.

## Mitigation — Reducing Emissions
Mitigation means lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Key steps include switching to renewable energy (wind, solar), improving energy efficiency, electrifying transport, and protecting forests. Policies like carbon pricing or emissions limits help guide business and government actions.

## Adaptation — Living with Change
Even with strong mitigation, some climate change will happen. Adaptation means preparing for those changes. Examples include building flood defenses, improving water use, changing crop varieties, and planning cities to stay cooler. Communities also need early warning systems for extreme events.

## International Cooperation
Climate change is global. Countries negotiate agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, which sets goals to limit warming and encourages national plans to reduce emissions. Wealthier nations often support poorer nations to help them adapt and shift to clean energy.

## Individual Actions and Collective Power
Small actions can add up: reducing car use, saving energy, eating less meat, and cutting food waste. However, larger shifts come from business and policy. Voting for climate-friendly policies, supporting local clean energy projects, and community efforts magnify individual actions.

## Closing Thoughts
Tackling climate change needs both short-term actions and long-term planning. Science helps us understand risks and pathways. Technology and policy changes can lower emissions and protect communities. Preparing wisely makes societies stronger and safer for future generations.
