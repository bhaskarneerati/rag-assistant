# Cybersecurity and Blockchain — Protecting Data and Building Trust

## Cybersecurity Basics
Cybersecurity protects systems, networks, and data from damage or theft. Threats include malware, phishing, ransomware, and denial-of-service attacks. Good security includes strong passwords, patches and updates, firewalls, and training people to spot scams.

## Common Threats and Defenses
Phishing tricks people into sharing credentials. Malware infects systems and can log keystrokes or corrupt files. Ransomware locks files and asks for payment. Defenses include anti-malware tools, network segmentation, backups, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) which asks for more than one form of proof to log in.

## Data Privacy and Regulation
Privacy means people control how their data is used. Laws like GDPR set rules for collecting and storing personal data. Organizations should minimize the data they keep, encrypt sensitive information, and allow people to access or remove their data when possible.

## What is Blockchain?
A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions in blocks linked by cryptographic hashes. Each block records multiple transactions and references the previous block. This chaining makes it hard to change past records without notice. Blockchains can be public (open to anyone) or private (permissioned), depending on the use case.

## Blockchain for Security and Trust
Blockchain provides tamper-evident records useful for auditing and certificates. For example, supply chain data can be recorded on a blockchain so anyone with access can verify the origin of a product. Blockchain does not remove the need for good software design and key management, but it can strengthen trust where many parties must agree on a shared record.

## Smart Contracts and Risks
Smart contracts are programs that run on blockchains. They automate agreements like payments when conditions are met. However, smart contracts can contain bugs. If a smart contract has a flaw, it may allow attackers to drain funds. Careful code review and audits are necessary.

## Practical Uses and Limits
Blockchain powers cryptocurrencies, tokenized assets, and some identity systems. In cybersecurity, blockchain helps timestamp logs, create audit trails, and share threat information across organizations in a tamper-resistant way. But blockchains are not a cure-all: they do not protect against weak passwords, insider threats, or poorly designed systems.

## Best Practices
Combine blockchain with strong cybersecurity. Use encryption, strong authentication, and regular audits. For sensitive uses, select permissioned blockchains and limit who can write to the ledger. Always plan for backups and incident response.
