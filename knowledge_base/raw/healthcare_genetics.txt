# Healthcare and Genetics — How Genes Shape Health and Care

## What are Genes and DNA?
Genes are segments of DNA that carry instructions for building proteins. These proteins help form tissues and perform functions. Humans have thousands of genes that influence traits and health. Genes interact with environment and lifestyle to affect disease risk and response to treatments.

## Genetic Testing and Use Cases
Genetic tests look for differences in DNA that may increase disease risk or affect drug response. Tests range from single-gene checks to whole-genome sequencing. Clinical uses include diagnosing rare disorders, guiding cancer therapy choices, and screening newborns. Tests also reveal carrier status for inherited conditions.

## Precision Medicine
Precision medicine uses genetic, environmental, and lifestyle information to tailor care. For example, some drugs work better for people with specific genetic markers. Precision medicine aims to give the right treatment at the right dose to the right person, reducing side effects and improving outcomes.

## Ethical and Privacy Concerns
Genetic data reveals sensitive family information. People must give informed consent before tests. Privacy safeguards are essential to prevent misuse. Laws and guidelines help protect people’s data, but risks remain, such as discriminatory use of genetic information by insurers or employers.

## Public Health and Screening
Population screening can detect conditions early. Newborn screening tests prevent serious illness when treatment is available. Public health programs weigh benefits, costs, and the ethical implications of wide genetic screening.

## Research and Future Directions
The falling cost of sequencing enables large studies linking genes to disease. Researchers study how genes interact with environment (gene-environment interaction). Future work aims to make genetic tests more useful clinically and to expand treatments that target genetic causes.
